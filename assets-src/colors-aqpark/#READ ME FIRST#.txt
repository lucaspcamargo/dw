1) CREDITS
The tilesets contained within were originally created by SEGA 
and Dimps.  The rip was created via an automated process by 
Techokami, with information and help from JoseTB & Retriever II.

If you use the contents of this package, you must give credit
to SEGA, Dimps, and Techokami.

If you did not download this tileset from the following domains:
http://holenet.info/
http://www.spriters-resource.com/
http://www.sonicfangameshq.com/
http://www.themfz.com/
http://sonicretro.org/
then you should immediately start yelling at the webmaster for
mirroring this file without permission.
PROTIP: If you ask first, I'll almost always say yes!

2) THE RIPPING PROCESS
Sonic Colors' levels are stored in the ROM filesystem as .NARC
(Nintendo/Nitro Archive) files. Inside the archive are several
files, all LZ77 compressed, that contain the pallete, tile, and
block data. Once decompressed, the files were fed into a modified
version of my Sonic Advance level ripper, generating individual
PNG files. The script is available under a BSD license (e.g. do
whatever you want, but give credit) from holenet.info at the 
following location:

3) EXPLANATION OF TILESET
Due to a limitation on the DS graphical system, you cannot have
tile priority, only layer priority. In order to have parts of the
level appear in front of Sonic, it is formed by combining layers
BG2 (bottom) and BG3 (top) with the Object layer in between.

The levels are built from 64x64 pixel blocks. Do NOT alter their
dimensions or they will NOT work correctly!

The background itself is completely separate from the block and
tile data, so they have not been ripped. They will not be ripped.
DO NOT ASK FOR BACKGROUND RIPS.

6) BLAZEFIRE IS A THIEF
This kid loves to steal other people's code and graphics, and call them
his own.  Why does anyone allow him to use the internet anymore?
BlazeFire, if you are reading this, don't bother ripping from this game,
Ragey and I will do things right.  Now GO KILL YOU'RE SAELF

7) THE END
Enjoy the tilesets.
